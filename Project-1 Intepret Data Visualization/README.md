# Project Description

A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. To give you some practice with this, we’ve selected a few Tableau dashboards for you to explore. The links are below, under "Choose from these Dashboards." Choose one of these dashboards, whichever one interests you the most, and find **three insights** in the visualizations. For each insight, **provide a static image** that shares what you found. Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether (including images), your report should be 1-2 pages.

## Choose from these dashboards 

- Madrid In Detail
- [x] Malaria In Africa
- Linkedin Top Skills

## Tableau Public dashboard

I used this [Malaria Deaths in Africa](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/naledi.hollbruegge/viz/MakeoverMonday34Malaria/MalariainAfrica) tableau public link to analyze the data.
