The [Business Analytics](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analytics-nanodegree--nd098) Nanodegree Program by Udacity is designed to help students gain foundational skills in data analysis and make more data-driven decisions. The program focuses on teaching data analysis skills and tools, including **`Excel`**, **`SQL`**, and **`Tableau`**, to help students manipulate, analyze, and visualize data. The end goal is to equip students with the skills necessary to make informed decisions based on data. The program includes projects designed to reinforce these skills and provide practical experience. This repository contains projects for this program.

# Program Syllabus

## COURSE 1: Welcome to the Program
### Project 1 - Interpret a Data Visualization 
A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. This project will build your intuition on working with data dashboards, while also showing you the types of beautiful visualizations you will be able to produce by the end of this program.

## COURSE 2: Introduction to Data
Learn how to use statistics and visuals to find and communicate insights. Develop Excel skills to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data in a spreadsheet. Build Excel models to analyze possible business outcomes.
### Project 2 - Analyze NYSE Data
In this project, you will work with a New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) dataset that contains
fundamental financial data for 500 companies. You will use spreadsheets to analyze and summarize the data using statistics and data visualizations. You will communicate the key findings in a professional manner. You will also design a dashboard that calculates the financial metrics and auto populates the income statement for each company using data validation and advanced lookup tools within `Excel`. You will then forecast financial metrics within the Income Statement, based on three scenarios with distinct assumptions for a company of your choice from the NYSE dataset. By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Calculate summary statistics using spreadsheets.
- Create data visualizations using spreadsheets.
- Ask questions and answer them using data.
- Work with real-world data that has missing and incorrect values.
- Calculate key business metrics in financial analysis and interpret values.
- Forecast financial metrics using scenario analysis.

## COURSE 3: SQL for Data Analysis
In this project, you will be provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. You’ll use statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report your conclusions and recommendations in a report.
### Project 3 - Query Digital Music Store Database 
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Write `SQL` to query a single table.
- Write `SQL` to query multiple tables.
- Ask a question that requires data from multiple places, join the data together, and answer the question.
- Install `SQL` on your own machine, upload a database, ask complex questions about the data in a database, and query the database to answer those questions.

## COURSE 4: Data Visualization with Tableau
Sharing insights is an integral part of working with data. In this project, you’ll build interactive dashboards with `Tableau` to tell stories from data. You’ll use a dataset of flight delays in the US to visualize the quality of airlines and airports, find the best times to fly, and more. These types of visualizations help guide decision making to reach the best outcomes.
### Project 4 - Build Data Dashboards
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Select the most appropriate data visualization for an analysis.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of a data visualization.
- Build interactive and engaging `Tableau` dashboards.
