## Project Introduction

In this project, you’ll have the opportunity to combine a lot of what you’ve learned throughout this entire program. This project may seem challenging and there isn’t a lot of guidance provided, as we want you to have the freedom to be creative. That dataset that you are working with is real and it is pretty big. When you are analyst for a company, there often isn’t guidance as to how to correctly answer a particular question. And there might not really be one right answer. Leverage your own skills. Make sure you look through the directions carefully.

## Project Description
In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

There are 3 different data sets you can choose from.

- Flight Delays and Cancellations
- [x] US Census Demographic Data
- Youtube Data from the US

### US Census Demographic Data

This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it includes the census data for all counties in 2015. You can find the dataset in supporting materials at the bottom of this page. Required dashboards

You are required to create three visualizations. Some questions you may attempt to answer include those pertaining to the following areas:

1. **Which states have the best transportation?**

This is a fairly subjective question, so your first job is to define what the best transportation is. Is it highest percentage of transit use? Is it lowest mean commute times. Then you need to determine how to aggregate the data from the county level to the state. Are there outlier counties affecting the data? How should you aggregate all the data from the counties to represent the state effectively? Please provide your reasoning in your report.

2. **How does income and poverty look across America?**

Think about how best to contrast this data to show an interesting finding. You can look across many of the different fields to show interesting findings. Do counties with more construction experience more or less poverty? Do counties near the coast experiene more or less income? Remember this is all correlation and not causation so we cannot say any one thing causes it but we can report descriptive statistics.

3. **You can also come up with your own question!**

As you work with the data, come up with a question you're curious about and can be answered from the data. Build a dashboard or story to answer your question and lead viewers to that answer.

### Reminder 

Your visualization work should use Tableau: other visualization tools may not be evaluated by reviewers. Host your dashboards/stories on Tableau Public, you'll be submitting them to reviewers and this makes them easily accessible.

Remember that your visualization should be explanatory in nature and communicate specific results that you want to show.

### Submission

- A PDF or Markdown report that includes the following sections:
  - Links to your dashboards or story
  - You must submit url links for each of your visuals from Tableau Public. If you need a reminder on how to save to Tableau Public, please see the next concept.
  - Summary: brief description of the visualization and the main story or findings conveyed
  - Design: explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
  - Resources: list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, GitHub repositories etc that you referred to or used in this submission (Add N/A if you did not use such resources).

# My Project

- I centered my project around the demographic data from the U.S. census, aiming to shed light on population demographics, economic conditions, and transportation methods. To provide an in-depth understanding of these data sets, I utilized three distinct dashboards.

#### Dashboard 1 
- The first dashboard, "Population Distribution," analyzes the population distribution using a map chart to show population density, a bar chart to display the demographic distribution of various races in each state, and a stacked bar chart to compare population share between men and women. The dashboard also uses a box plot to showcase the distribution of the gender ratio by state and a treemap visualization to display the proportion of citizens in each state. These visualizations provide an intuitive and easily digestible way to understand demographic data. The dashboard employs visually appealing colors and a filter to limit the number of states displayed, making it more accommodating for color-blind viewers.

#### Dashboard 2
- The second dashboard, "Income, Poverty, and Unemployment," analyzes socio-economic indicators for states using a packed bubble chart to show child poverty numbers by state, a scatter plot to display the relationship between average income and poverty by state, and a text graph to show the unemployment rate by state. The packed bubble chart highlights states with the highest number of children living in poverty, while the scatter plot reveals any relationships between income and poverty by state. The text graph presents the unemployment rate of each state in a straightforward manner and highlights the state with the highest unemployment rate.

#### Dashboard 3
- The "Transportation Dashboard" is the third dashboard that provides an analysis of transportation patterns. It displays the mean commute time and the most frequently used modes of transportation in each state. The average commute time is displayed using a bar chart, while a stacked bar chart is used to show the most commonly used mode of transportation in each state.
